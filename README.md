This code was written by Raimova Roza. This is a classic Game of life, but with the random appearance of the first cells. Code instructions in the comments. To test the code, run it and set the number of rows and columns in the input.

Now I did some changes in my project. (in github)I forgot about description , and just wrote it. But I uploaded my project 3 days earlier (on 2nd April). Hope you don't downvote for this.
